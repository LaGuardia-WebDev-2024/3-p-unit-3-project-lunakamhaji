  <h1>My Cats</h1>
  <p><em>Luna Kamhaji</em></p>
  <p class="important">
    I have two cats at home named Ash and Max. Ash is 6 months old, and Max is 5 years old. <br>
    Until last spring, we had a black cat named Zoro who passed away from lymphoma. <br>
    Due to his death, Max unfortunately fell into a depressive state where he would refuse <br>
    to eat food. Seeing this, we made the difficult decision to adopt a kitten in order for <br>
    Max to have company.
  </p>

  <h2><em>Ash</em></h2>
  <p class="playful">
    We adopted my kitten Ash when he was around 1 month old. <br>
    His litter was found abandoned by their feral mother in a construction site <br>
    by a young couple in Brooklyn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although he was a bit timid when he first arrived at our house, <br>
    he has now grown to be a friendly, agile, and playful cat who enjoys <br>
    the presence of people. <br>
    He eats almost everything, to the point where I can't leave food out around him.<br>
  </p>
  <img id="ash-photo" 
       src="https://cdn.glitch.global/63e88b68-588c-42a2-aae9-fba30e35402f/92aaa4aa-af97-48a8-9026-a27070222836.Web%20Dev%20Project%20(3).jpg?v=1727886955573">
  <p>
    He loves to sit in very confined spaces, enjoys getting attention, and <br>
    <strong>loves</strong> to eat food. He is more on the extroverted side and will sometimes cuddle. <br>
    I believe that he can entertain himself with anything around him and <br>
    is very curious. <br>
    <u>Some of the things I find him playing with are:</u>
    <ul>
      <li>Pieces of string</li>
      <li>Bottle caps</li>
      <li>Tissue/Toilet paper</li>
      <li>Wires</li>
      <li>My hair</li>
    </ul>

  <h3><em>Max</em></h3>
  <p class="playful">
    We adopted Max from a cat cafe in Brooklyn sometime in 2019 when he was around <br>
    one year old. He was very playful and curious, but when my other cat Zoro passed away, <br>
    Max was very distraught and started to refuse any food and only wanted to sleep. <br>
    After we adopted Ash, he has become a bit more energetic.<br>
  </p>
  <img id="max-photo" 
       src="https://cdn.glitch.global/63e88b68-588c-42a2-aae9-fba30e35402f/6d1b7d48-0eb6-485b-809c-277253f9e0d5.image.png?v=1728932938857">
  <p>
    Max was very skinny and fragile during his first couple of years with us. <br>
    He used to be a stray and was found with a <mark>spinal injury</mark>, which he got surgery <br>
    for and fortunately recovered, although he has always been a bit clumsy, especially <br>
    in his back legs/lower body. For some reason, recently he suddenly gained a lot of weight <br>
    and we were told he is <u>overweight</u> by the vet. <br>
    He is a very friendly and curious cat, but it is a bit rare for him to cuddle. <br>
